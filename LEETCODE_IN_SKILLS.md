# LeetCode Stats - Moved to Skills Section ✅

## What Changed

LeetCode statistics are now integrated directly into the **Skills & Expertise** section as a compact card, showing only the 3 most important metrics.

### Before:
❌ Separate full section with multiple cards  
❌ Showed 6+ different metrics  
❌ Took up lots of space

### After:
✅ Compact card in Skills section  
✅ Shows only 3 key metrics  
✅ Cleaner, more professional look

## What's Displayed

The LeetCode card now shows:

1. **Total Solved** - Total number of problems solved
2. **Global Rank** - Your ranking among all LeetCode users
3. **Rating** - Your acceptance rate percentage

Plus a link to view your full LeetCode profile.

## Location

You'll find it in the **Skills & Expertise** section as the 5th skill category:
- Programming Languages
- Cloud & Infrastructure
- Systems & DevOps
- Databases & Frameworks
- **LeetCode Stats** ← Here!

## Design

The LeetCode stats card:
- Matches the style of other skill categories
- Has gradient numbers for visual appeal
- Shows a spinner while loading
- Displays "Stats unavailable" if APIs fail
- Includes a "View Profile" link

## Mobile Responsive

On mobile devices, it stacks vertically just like the other skill categories.

## API Behavior

- **Silent loading**: No console spam
- **Multiple fallbacks**: Tries 3 different APIs
- **Fast loading**: Uses the fastest available API
- **Graceful failure**: Shows link if APIs are down

## Benefits

1. **Space efficient**: No separate section needed
2. **Context appropriate**: Showcases coding skills
3. **Clean design**: Matches the rest of the portfolio
4. **User-friendly**: Key stats at a glance
5. **Professional**: Not overwhelming with data

## Files Modified

- ✅ `index.html` - Removed separate section, added to Skills grid

- ✅ `css/style.css` - New compact styles, removed old section styles
